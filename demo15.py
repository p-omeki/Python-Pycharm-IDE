#Dictionaries in Python
'''
In a simple definition of Dictionary, we'll say it's a book that you look up to it for meaning of words.
Now, in python, dictionaries are types of data structures that map random keys to their respective values.
Dictionaries are similar to list but there are several  differences among them that stands out. This are:
  1. Dictionaries are enclosed in curly braces while list are in square brackets.
  2. In Dict., it allows storage of more than one data to it while in list you can only pass a single line of data.
'''
# Creating a dictionary of people and their respective age.
people = {"Patrick": 23, "John Doe": 50} #We've declared two data Patrick and John Doe with their respective age.

print(people["Patrick"]) #This will print the age of John Doe, 50.

'''In the dictionary above, we've defined the key as the string and the value as the integer. But, we can also define 
it the other way. Check demo15.1
