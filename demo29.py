#Itertools in python
'''
Itertools are modules used as tools in functional programming. Since they're modules, for us to use them we simply have
to import them to our code. Itertools have different function used with it, but on this article we are going to focus
on three functions that are mostly used. This includes:
       1.The count ~ The function iterates a number to infinite once the start is specified.
       2.The accumulate ~ The function adds the corresponding
       3.The takewhile ~ The function takes an element from a list while a certain condition is TRUE.
