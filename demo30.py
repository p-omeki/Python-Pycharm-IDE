#Operator Overloading In Python
'''
Operator overloading is a method that allows us to perform an operation on a code, either addition or subtraction by
overloading an operator, +/- . Now, a normal add or sub operation we'll declare the operation and run the code, here
the +/- result is given based on the particular function definition we've defined and so, we decide what the operator
will do, not just add automatically.
