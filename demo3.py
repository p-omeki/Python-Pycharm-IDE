#Creating List in Python
'''
List in python are data structures that allow one to store data on to it. Similarly, lists are like arrays in other programming languages.
And what are arrays? A collection of elements of the same kind placed together in a contiguous(Sharing a border) memory location and can
be individually referenced by using an index to a unique identifier.

#Creating a list of my pals in University
Names = ["Patrick", "Bahati", "Klein", "Nigel", "Naftal", "Moyale"] #First, we've declared our values in square brackets.

print(Names) #This will print all the names in the List.

'''However, list also have positions in them and they're identified using an index [0.....] which starts from 0. So, if we want
to access "Moyale" individally, we'll specify index[5]

print(Names[5])
